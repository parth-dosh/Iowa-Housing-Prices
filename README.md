# Iowa-Housing-Prices

#### Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. It is always the sales price. However, does the sales price depend on other attributes too? 

#### I collaborated on a project with Iowa State University's Economic Development Board on the Housing Readiness Assessment model to predict home prices in Ames, IA where there college is located. 

#### With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this project challenged me to explore a variety of different numerical and categorical variables, narrow them down and build models to predict home prices. 

#### I created 3 ML models using the Decision Tree Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor with Max Leaf Nodes and the Random Forest Regressor and compared each one's MAE value to optimize the one which had the lowest error and tested it against a 1500 home dataset from Ames,IA to build and test the final model.
